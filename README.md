# People Name Classifier Web Application using character level RNN model

This interactive web application is an extension of the People Name Classifier project, which utilizes a character-level RNN model to discern if a given string is a person's name. Building upon the core functionality of the [character level model repository](https://github.com/rohithramesh1991/name_classifier_challenge_Char_Rnn.git), 
this application provides a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a Flask web application that interfaces with the People Name Classifier model. Users can enter strings, and the application will classify them as a person's name or not.
